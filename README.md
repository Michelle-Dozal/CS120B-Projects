# CS120B-Labs
The Files of all the projects while taking CS120B (Intro to Embedded Systems) at University of California, Riverside in Spring 2020. The main purpose of the course was to become familiar and comfortable designing, programming, and setting up "embedded systems"

## Tools
The code was all written in C language with all the breadboard supplies. The ATMEGA-33 Pinout microcontroller was the "brain" to all the hardware designs and was coded with the C code.  


## Testing
Using AVR-GDB manually GDB allows us to write scripts to feed input to our program and display the output. Coupled with SimAVR we were able to write sequences of input and trace how those inputs generate the output to verify correct functionality of our program. This is how we "tested" our code besides seeing it on the breadboard.
